Title:
Comparative Performance Analysis of Light and Dark Themes on a Website

Description:
This project analyzes the performance of two themes, Light and Dark, on a website using various key metrics: Click Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, and Scroll Depth. By employing hypothesis testing, we aim to determine which theme provides a better user experience and engagement. The analysis is based on a dataset containing user interaction data for both themes.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to utilize hypothesis testing to compare the performance of the Light and Dark themes on a website. Specifically, we aim to:

Define and test hypotheses to determine if there are significant differences in user engagement metrics (CTR, Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Scroll Depth) between the Light and Dark themes.
Analyze the results to provide insights into which theme performs better overall.
Offer data-driven recommendations for theme selection to optimize user engagement and website performance.
